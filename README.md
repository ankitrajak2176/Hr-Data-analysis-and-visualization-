🚀 **Project Spotlight: HR Data Analysis and Visualization** 🚀

I’m thrilled to share my first project in data analysis, where I had the opportunity to deep dive into HR data to uncover insights and trends. Here’s a breakdown of what I accomplished:

🔍 Data Cleaning and Analysis:
- Utilized PostgreSQL to clean and analyze HR data.
- Handled null values and missing data efficiently.
- Applied data normalization techniques to ensure data consistency.

📊 Key Insights:
- Found an overall attrition rate of 16% in the dataset.
- Analyzed average employee age and its correlation with attrition.
- Examined attrition rates across different job roles.
- Investigated demographic factors affecting employee turnover.
- Explored aspects of employee wellness and job satisfaction.

📊 Data Visualization:
- Created compelling visualizations using Power BI to highlight key findings and trends.

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in data management, SQL querying, and data visualization, paving the way for impactful decision-making in HR operations.
